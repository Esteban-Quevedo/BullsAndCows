# bullsandcows-java

## Objective

This repo contains a Java application that brings the classic Bulls and Cows game. It features interactive menus and
various play modes to provide an engaging gaming experience.

## Content

This project is a Java-based game that implements the classic Bulls and Cows guessing game. The program is structured
using three main classes, each equipped with their own getters, setters, and methods, along with the required
conditionals, loops, and logic to guarantee the game's structure and operation:

1. Player Class: This class defines the attributes and behaviors of a player, allowing for the creation and management
   of user profiles.

2. Level Class: This class encapsulates the various difficulty levels, handles points calculation, generates random
   combinations for the player to guess, and manages the game progress.

3. Game Class: This final class orchestrates the game experience. It creates a new player, assigns a level, and tracks
   the number of attempts, the player's previous guesses, and the number of bulls and cows achieved. In the event that
   the player does not reach the specified number of attempts, it handles end-game scenarios.
